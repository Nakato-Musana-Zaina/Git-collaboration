Heaps
These are defined as binary tree data structures where a parent node can either be equal to or less than the child node, or it could be that the parent node is greater than or equal to the parent node.
In a max heap, the child node is greater than the parent node 
Whereas in a min heap, the child node is lesser than the parent node.
A root is the node that is at the top of a tree.


The following are the primary operations in heap data structure:
Insertion
Deletion
Extraction of the minimum and  largest value

Characteristics of a heap data structure:
Heaps have nodes and each of the nodes has a value.
Heaps are implemented as arrays.

Some of the advantages of heaps:
It allows you to add new items.
It is easy to access the minimum and maximum values.

Some of the disadvantages of heaps:
It is difficult to look for other elements.
It takes longer to execute commands.

Applications of Heaps:
Priority queues: elements are stored in order of their priority
Job scheduling: work/tasks can be scheduled according to their priority or deadline.
Patients; it can be used to prioritize patients.
